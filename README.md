Description!
---------------
I re-created an User Interface from Rockstar's game, Grand Theft Auto 5. I used React.js, javascript, HTML, and CSS to do this.

I used this image from Google Images to design the layout of my mock website.

Upon building the site, I realized that the images under 'SPONSORED ADVERT' and 'EYEFIND FEATURED WEBSITES" were too blurry/pixelated to put into my site. I then decided to log-in to my account on the game and take a screenshot so that I could get clearer image. This is what the official interface looks like.

This is what my version looks like

Instructions!
-----------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and use "npm start" to start a development server
3. A new webpage should automatically appear showing the site, or open localhost:3000 on any web browser.
